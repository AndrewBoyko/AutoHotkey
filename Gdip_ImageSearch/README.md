# About Gdip_ImageSearch()

Gdip_ImageSearch() was originally created by **tic** and **Rseding91**.
It was not included in **tic**'s GDI+ Library as it's considered a work in progress.
I am mantaining here the original version of the function, as well as my modifications.

# More Information
Forum links:
* [Latest Gdip_ImageSearch version][orig]
* **tic**'s GDI+ Library[gdip]

# Licenses
* AutoHotkey is licensed under GPL v2
* **tic**'s library "*can be distributed for commercial and non-commercial use*"
Noted the above facts, Gdip_ImageSearch() should probably fall into the GPL category.
